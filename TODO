- other primitives in interpreter:
  D [ ] (if)
  D { } (do-while)
  - f (byte fetch)
  D s (byte store)
  D < (less than)
  D * (empty space allocation)
  D G (read a byte of input or return -1)
D get it to copy its input into its output
- get it to "assemble" a dumb string of instruction bytes
  D [ ]
  D { }
  D @ !
  - f 
  D s
  D +
  D ~
  D < (done I hope)
  D ^ to set the entry point
  D ;
  D :
  D #
  D b
  D v
  D *
  D ( space newline
  D numeric literals
  D function calls
  D G W Q
D hey, what about initializing %ebp?
D fix interpreter to allow past-the-end access
D fix compiler to compile itself past the end of itself
D fix bug where comments left crap on the compile-time stack

Then simplifications:
D replace + and ~ with -
D factor out w 48 - n (okay, 48 - n is now n, but we still have w n and n)
- factor out H @ + H !
D factor out h - o @ + (had to be done to compile past the end of itself)

And cleanups:
- permit multi-character tokens
D update comment at the top
D add a way to include ASCII characters by example instead of numeric value
