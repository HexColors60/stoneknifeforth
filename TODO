- other primitives in interpreter:
  D [ ] (if)
  D { } (do-while)
  - f (byte fetch)
  D s (byte store)
  D < (less than)
  D * (empty space allocation)
  D G (read a byte of input or return -1)
D get it to copy its input into its output
- get it to "assemble" a dumb string of instruction bytes
  D [ ]
  D { }
  D @ !
  - f 
  D s
  D +
  D ~
  D < (done I hope)
  D ^ to set the entry point
  D ;
  D :
  D #
  D b
  D v
  D *
  D ( space newline
  D numeric literals
  D function calls
  D G W Q
D hey, what about initializing %ebp?

Okay, the only thing left to do is to make the compiler use a space
past the end of itself to generate its output.
